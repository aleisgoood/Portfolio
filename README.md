## :dart: About ##

Hello! This is my first website: it's my personal portfolio that I will update with my own projects.
It is made entirely with pure HTML and CSS (no Javascript).

The inspiration behind the design, the colors and the background image, come from my passion about the universe and retro videogames. :star:
I chose warm tones, like orange and deep blue.

In this website you can find my Portfolio, with all my projects (that will be updated everytime!), my CV (made with CSS), a few lines about myself and my hobbies, and my skills and Social Media.

You can find here:

Made with :heart: by <a href="https://github.com/{{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}}" target="_blank">{{YOUR_NAME}}</a>
